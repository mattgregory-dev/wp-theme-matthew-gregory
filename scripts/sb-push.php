/**
 * Direct-to-DB PUSH. Writes wp/.work/<slug>.html into the slug-matched page's
 * post_content.
 *
 * Correctness guards (load-bearing):
 *
 *   1. Runs as an administrator. WP-CLI's default user-0 context has kses
 *      ACTIVE, which silently strips <iframe>, <script> and inline SVG — so
 *      embeds and inline-SVG markup survive the editor but vanish through a raw
 *      write. wp_set_current_user() fires 'set_current_user' → kses_init()
 *      re-runs → an admin has unfiltered_html → the kses filters drop.
 *   2. wp_slash() before save: wp_insert_post() unslashes its input, so
 *      unslashed content containing backslashes would corrupt. Slashing first
 *      makes the write byte-exact.
 *
 * Safety guards (added after a stale push scrubbed ~20 minutes of live editor
 * work):
 *
 *   A. STALE-PUSH GUARD (optimistic lock). Refuses to push unless the current DB
 *      content still matches the baseline hash recorded at the last sb-pull of
 *      this page. If the DB changed since that pull — someone edited it in the
 *      block editor — it ABORTS rather than clobbering. Re-pull to refresh the
 *      baseline and reconcile first. There is NO override flag, on purpose.
 *   B. PRE-PUSH BACKUP. The current DB content is copied to
 *      .work/backups/<slug>-<utc-timestamp>.html before any write, so every push
 *      is instantly reversible.
 *
 *   docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp eval-file \
 *     wp-content/themes/mg-blocks/scripts/sb-push.php <slug>

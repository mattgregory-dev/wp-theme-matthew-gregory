# MG Blocks — conventions

Read this before working in this repo. This theme is a clone of Starter Blocks,
the Full Site Editing starter meant to be reseeded per project (see
[docs/PIPELINE.md](docs/PIPELINE.md), Stage 0). The conventions below are what
the clone inherits and must not drift from.

## Permanent, shared identifiers

These are shared across **every** cloned project and are **append-only** — never
rename or repurpose an existing one; only add:

| Concern | Value |
|---|---|
| Block namespace | `starter-blocks/*` |
| Generated block class | `wp-block-starter-blocks-*` |
| PHP function prefix | `sb_*` |
| `@package` docblock | `starter-blocks` |
| Pattern category | slug `starter-blocks`, label "Starter Blocks" |

A rename silently breaks downstream references (inserted patterns forked into the
DB, inline classes, translations), which is why the rule is absolute.

The **text domain is the exception** — it is per-theme, `mg-blocks`
here, matching the directory name and the `style.css` header as WordPress
expects. It carries no cross-project references (no translation files ship with
the starter), so it is safe to reseed where the identifiers above are not.

## Design tokens

The `theme.json` palette is **role-based, not descriptive** — slugs name what a
color does, not what it is. A clone changes the *values*, never the *slugs*.

`base`, `contrast`, `contrast-2`, `surface-1`, `surface-2`, `surface-3`,
`surface-dark`, `border`, `muted`, `link`, `link-hover`, `error`.

- **Append-only**, same as the identifiers above.
- **Surfaces are luminance-ordered, lightest first** (`surface-1` lightest of the
  light set → `surface-3` darkest of it; `surface-dark` is the dark surface).
  New surfaces slot into that order.
- **Markup references tokens only.** All pattern/block markup uses preset slugs
  and `var(--wp--preset--*)` values — no literal hex, no raw px. This holds even
  in throwaway prototype markup, because prototype markup becomes production
  markup in this pipeline.

The font families are roles too (a serif heading stack, a sans body stack); swap
values, keep roles.

## Build & styling

- **One pipeline, git-ignored output:** Vite (`src/` → `dist/`). This theme is
  **native-first** — core blocks and patterns, no custom block layer.
- **Styling priority:** `theme.json` → block markup/attributes → block style
  variations (`is-style-*`) → `src/style.scss` (escape hatch only: pseudo-
  elements, `:has()`, keyframes, JS-state classes). The SCSS layer always
  references tokens and never redefines one.
- **A SCSS partial rides with its feature.** New block/variation/pattern → its
  stylesheet and a matching `@use` line land in the same change.
- Run `npm run lint` (eslint + stylelint + phpcs + block-grammar audit) before
  considering a change done.

## Blocks vs. patterns

A custom block is justified by **propagation, logic, or controls** — many
instances sharing a centrally-updated structure, `render.php` computation/
sanitization, or typed editor controls beyond core + block bindings. Breakable
structure **alone** is a pattern (use `templateLock` / block bindings for a safe
editing surface). See [docs/PIPELINE.md](docs/PIPELINE.md), Stage 4.

## Commit discipline

- **Conventional Commits, spec types only:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`,
  `build`, `ci`, `perf`, `docs`. One idea per commit; the history is part of the
  deliverable.
- Commit **bodies only when the diff can't tell the story alone** (a non-obvious
  why or a gotcha) — no filler bodies.
- **No em dashes in marketing prose.** Docs, docblocks, and pattern descriptions
  may use them freely; visitor-facing copy may not.
